# GlazeOS

__GlazeOS__ is a new operating system based on debian that has a _minimalist_, and _userfriendly_ look. It uses its own de. 

The plan is, there's a panel on the bottom of the screen. Layout of the applets are similar to that of solus budgie or windows 10. The app launcher has a transparency effect, has rounded corners, and is slightly away from the screen's edges (reference image below)
